Explanation of Implementation Choices

For this project, I have intentionally kept the implementation minimalistic and did not use any third-party libraries or frameworks. The only technology used is TypeScript.

I want to clarify that TypeScript, by itself, does not provide pre-built components, UI frameworks, or automated features that simplify application development. Its primary purpose is to add type safety, better tooling, and code maintainability to JavaScript. It does not reduce the amount of coding or architectural work required, and all the core logic, UI interactions, and functionality in this project were implemented manually.

This decision was intentional to demonstrate clean, well-organized code and a strong understanding of the underlying principles without relying on external dependencies. Every feature, from data handling to UI updates, is coded from scratch, ensuring clarity and maintainability.

I hope this explanation clarifies my approach. Using only TypeScript was a conscious choice to keep the project lightweight and self-contained, not to cut corners.
