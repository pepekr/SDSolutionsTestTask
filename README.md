**Setup**

Install TypeScript as a development dependency:

**npm install typescript --save-dev**

**Compile and Watch**

To compile TypeScript files and watch for changes:

**npx tsc --watch**


This will generate JavaScript files in the dist folder (as configured in tsconfig.json).

**Run**

Open your index.html in a browser. The compiled JavaScript from dist will be loaded automatically.
